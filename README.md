# Heat Equation Simulation

This project simulates heat diffusion along a 1D rod using the finite difference method.

## Features
- Uses MATLAB to simulate heat distribution over time.
- Implements explicit time-stepping for solving the heat equation.
- Displays results using both line plots and colormaps.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bruno-mendel/Heat-equation-in-1D.git

2. Open the MATLAB script heat_simulation.m and run it.
## How It Works
- The rod is initially set at a uniform temperature of 20°C.
- The left boundary is fixed at 100°C, and the right at 50°C.
- The simulation updates the temperature over time based on thermal diffusion.

## Visualization
- Line Plot: Shows temperature evolution at different time steps.
- Colormap: Provides a visual representation of temperature distribution.
